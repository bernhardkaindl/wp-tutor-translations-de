The files are unchanged exports from:
* https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/tutor/stable/de/default/export-translations/
* https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/tutor/dev/de/default/export-translations/

the filter must be set to "all" and the criteria changed from "current"
to "only matching the filter":
